PyArchey2
=========

PyArchey2 drops support for Python 2.7. The motivation for PyArchey2 is performance. Main 
changes includes multi-threading to speed up information gathering and uses f-strings for 
string formatting. Also, added logging and bytes labels are expanded to yottabytes.

---

This is based off the ``archey`` command (which is also python) distributed by various
linux, unix, and osx package managers. In order to avoid a naming conflict between them,
I called this ``pyarchey``.

PyArchey is developed for and tested under Python 2.7, no guarrentee is made
about its suitability for Python 3.x. Pull requests adding 3.x support are
welcome.

Currently, ``pyarchey`` supports logos for Arch, Fedora, LinuxMint, Ubuntu, SUSE, Debian,
Raspbian, Gentoo, OpenBSD, generic Linux, and Slackware.

-------------
Requirements
-------------

Some of the custom code was removed and ``psutil`` was used to provide a cross-platform
solution.

--------
Install
--------

The preferred way is to use `pypi.org <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_ ::

    pip install pyarchey2

You can also do::

    git clone https://github.com/renyi/pyarchey2.git
    cd pyarchey
    python setup.py install

If you plan on doing some development, instead of ``install`` you can do ``develop``.

------
Usage
------

To run::

	pyarchey

args:

-d, --display     display ascii logos for all distributions
-h, --help        help
-j, --json        output json of system info, nothing is printed to the screen
-z, --zeroconfig  add ``.local`` to a hostname for zeroconfig to find IP address easier
--verbose         enables more verbose messages
--debug           print debug messages

--------
History
--------

As far as I am aware, this was started by @djmelik which was then forked by
@mikeantonacci where I forked it form him.
